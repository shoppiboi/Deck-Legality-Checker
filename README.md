# MTG Deck Legality Checker
This program was made specifically for decks generated in [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/). The main function of the program is to take in a Magic: The Gathering deck in .COD format and compare the cards against the mtgsdk library to determine whether the cards are allowed in any chosen game format.()]
